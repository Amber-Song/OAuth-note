# Overview

After logging into Teams with a Microsoft or Microsoft 365 account, users can access your app without needing to sign in again.
TODO: How does this work behind the scenes? Does Teams handle the sign-in process for you?

## SSO in Teams at runtime

![SSO runtime flow](./assets/sso-runtime-seqd.png)
1. The front-end of the tab app makes a JavaScript call to `getAuthToken()`, which tells the Teams application to get an access token. This token is valid only for consenting to a limited set of user-level APIs, such as email, profile, offline_access, and OpenId. Itâ€™s not used for other Graph scopes like User.Read or Mail.Read.
2. The Teams application requests an access token from the Microsoft Entra endpoint (Microsoft's authentication and authorization server) based on the current user's Teams identity.
3. If the user is using your tab app for the first time, Teams will display a consent prompt.
4. Microsoft Entra ID sends the access token (JWT) to the Teams Client. Teams caches the token on your behalf so that future calls to `getAuthToken()` return the cached token.
5. The Teams application sends the access token to the front-end of the tab app as part of the result from the `getAuthToken()` call.
6. The tab app parses the access token using JavaScript to extract required information.

When a custom app is integrated into Microsoft Teams, the Teams application essentially acts as a wrapper around the front-end of that custom app.

**Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory (Azure AD))**
: a service from Microsoft that helps organizations manage user identities and control access to resources like apps, services, and data.


## Difference between SSO and OAuth
**SSO**
: SSO allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple, related systems without needing to log in separately to each one. For example, logging into your Google account gives you access to Gmail, Google Drive, YouTube, etc., without requiring separate logins for each service.

**OAuth (Open Authorization)**
: OAuth is a protocol that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources. For example, a third-party app can access your Google Drive files after you grant permission, without needing your Google password. OAuth can be used as part of an SSO system.



# Configure your tab app in Microsoft Entra ID



# Add code to enable SSO



# Update app manifest for SSO and preview app



# Grant Microsoft Graph permissions and scopes
